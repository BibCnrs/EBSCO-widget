					"description": "The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by a disease with mainly respiratory tropism and varying severity. Viral excretion of COVID-19 has been described in both urine and stool with the risk of contamination by stool. No viral replication in the peritoneal dialysis fluid has been reported to date. We report an observation demonstrating the presence of the virus in the peritoneal dialysis drainage fluid of a COVID-19 patient. This underlines the importance in COVID-19 patients of considering dialysis fluid as a possible source of contamination."

					"description": "Nurses, doctors, healthcare workers, and other medical professionals who are testing for and treating patients with COVID-19 are at a higher risk of contracting it than the general public. The combination of stress and possible exposure puts healthcare professionals, from physicians and nurses, to specialists, at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 and potentially spreading it to others. Health professionals directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 develop the insertion of psychic spaces for the installation of pain and psychological suffering and other mental health symptoms. The foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals."

					"description": "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Whether the patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important issue worthy of clinical attention. This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> One hundred sixteen COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Twelve (10.8%) patients showed mild increase of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine (&lt;26 μmol/L within 48 h), and 8 (7.2%) patients showed trace or 1+ albuminuria in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). All these patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria of AKI. In addition, 5 patients with CKD who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before admission were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed as COVID-19. In addition to therapy for COVID-19, CRRT was also applied 3 times weekly during hospitalization for these 5 patients with CKD. In the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable state in all 5 patients with CKD, without exacerbation of CKD, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CKD were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without CKD, and 1 patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab from 5 cases with CKD. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> AKI was uncommon in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not result in AKI, or aggravate CKD in the COVID-19 patients."

					"description": "CERN against COVID-19 is coordinated by Beniamino Di Girolamo (CERN, ATS-DO)<br> CERN’s Director-General established the <strong><em>CERN against COVID-19</em></strong> task force in March 2020 to collect and coordinate ideas and contributions from the CERN community of over 18 000 people worldwide to the societal fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. These initiatives will draw on scientific and technical expertise and facilities at CERN, in the Member State countries and beyond, and will be carried out with that community and in close contacts with the relevant health institutions and experts from other fields.<br> We have been very encouraged by the hundreds of emails we have received, and the enthusiasm of the community to make a positive difference. Ideas range from the deployment of CERN’s powerful computing, engineering and technical resources to contribute to the global fight against COVID-19, to assisting the local effort through logistical and emergency response support.<br> The objective of the <strong><em>CERN against COVID-19</em> </strong>initiative is to ensure effective and well-coordinated action, drawing on CERN’s many competencies and advanced technologies and working closely with experts in healthcare, drug development, epidemiology and emergency response so as to maximise the impact of our contributions. Proposals and ideas for this group can be made by members of the CERN community via the form at the bottom of this page. Questions for the task force may be submitted via email to fight-covid@cern.ch. We will do our best to answer all of them."
